With his long ranged Fissure, the Earthshaker creates impassable terrain where none existed before. Up close, Raigor swings heavily with his Enchanted Totem, hitting thrice as hard...<a class="read-more-link" href="#">Read More</a>

                  The Rogue Knight lives by two creeds: Honor, as ordained by his own personal code, and solitude. Using his iron gauntlet, Sven throws out the Storm Hammer to stun multiple foes, then closes in to cut them down with Great Cleave. In the heat of battle, the Rogue Knight calls upon God's Strength...

Seemingly mild-mannered, the Stone Giant is nonetheless a force to behold as he brings down an Avalanche of boulders. With a simple Toss, Tiny throws friends and foes alike across the battlefield, while his Craggy Exterior turns the blades of any foolish enough to assail him...

Man or phantom, Kunkka's presence on the battlefield is duly felt by all. Armed with the legendary Tidebringer, the Admiral strikes with a single blow at all who stand before him. As a veteran of innumerable naval engagements, Kunkka times his skills with planned precision...

                   Raised in the royal menagerie of Slom, Karroch learned to converse with beasts from a young age.
                   With this unique talent, the Beastmaster is able to summon to his side a trusty Boar and a scouting Hawk.
                   In addition to his companions, Karroch has mastered the art of throwing Wild Axes, cutting down trees and foes before returning to his hands...

                  As Sir Davion slew Slyrak in arranged combat, the Eldwurm's blood mingled with his own, sealing their essences together. He was no longer a dragon-slayer, but a Dragon Knight. The infusion of Dragon Blood caused his wounds to heal with inhuman speed, and granted him great new powers...
